This highly modular MERN stack application, which is comprised of several thousand lines of code, makes calls to three news APIs at regular intervals, updating the frontend display accordingly. Users can save or like articles and 
the site will display the articles in various correspondent sub-categories: most popular, most recent and your saved. JWT tokens are used to preserve user security and the code is 
organised according to software engineering best principles, avoiding repetition and carefully siloing any sensitive information. The design style is simple but effective and the code
is mostly tested.
